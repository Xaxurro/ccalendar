Hi! Documenting my thought process and some recurring bugs. So, for starters let's define the MVP:

# Goals
## The program must be able to read `.cldr` files
`.cldr` files will be plain formatted text to store the user's events they want to save.
This file must be selected by the env variable `$CALENDAR_FILE` by default it's value is `~/calendar.cldr`, if it not exists, it creates it.

Line Structure to store an event should be as follows:
`<day> <month> <year> [tags] <event>`

Tags will contain some data that will help the user organize themselves like color coding their events or being able to filter events
Comments should be made by using `#`

## The program must be able to query events in the `.cldr` file
At the beggining it should be enough with querying events `before`, `now` and `after`. The events are measured in *days*

I will try to implement all of this today

---

# Future goals
## Tags
Tags change how the Event is displayed in text, these 5 options are planned
- Underline
- Italic
- Bold
- Color: Changes the color (Must be defined first, read ##Color-Definitions)
- Label: Allows the user to query events with certain labels, an event can have multiple of these

An Line Structure with all options would look like this:
`[underline, italic, bold, color=red, label=urgent]`

A tag can have repeated elements, but for `color` it will overwrite it's value with the last inserted value, in the case of `label` they will stack up without a clear max for now.

## Using a whole directory
Helps organization to read multiple separate `.cldr` files
Can store some data like **color definitions**, **time aliases**, **tags aliases**, etc.

## Color Definitions
Allowing the user to color code their tasks is really helpful to quickly visualize the kind of events stored.
Line Structure:
`color <color_name> <color_hex_value>`

I'm not sure if it should be on it's own file, but I think I will go with that after having the MVP

## Time Aliases
These will be defined to allow the user quickly query their events, example
`caledar query tomorrow` Shows events for the next day
`caledar query month` Shows all the events on the next 30 days

Line Structure:
`time <alias_name> <days_before_today> <days_after_today>` the last 2 arguments must be always integers `>= 0`, if `== 0` then it must count today (Always Inclusive)

## Tag Aliases
Instead of writting tons of the same tags, it's better to have a recurring alias of multiple tags, you can't have and alias AND additional tags.
Line Structure:
`tag <alias_name> <tags>` `<tags>` must have the same Line Structure as a regular tag

## Action `add` 
Usage: `calendar add <date> [tags] <description> [file]` to quickly add an event to the calendar

## Action `query` 
Usage: `calendar query <time_frame>` to query events inside `<time_frame>` (Inclusive)
Usage: `calendar query <time_frame> label <label>` to query events with certain `label` inside `<time_frame>` (Inclusive)

# Project Structure for MVP
The best would be to separate it like this:
```
.
├── main        # Useless for now, but will be responsible to indicate the action like `query` or `add`
├── event       # Main data structure
├── parser      # Parse the file
└── calendar    # Dates logic
```
